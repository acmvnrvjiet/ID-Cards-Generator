# ID-Cards-Generator
We at ACM VNR VJIET, have automated the traditional process of generating IDs of the members. 
We made this program that takes the member’s details as input, generates the IDs of the members along with a QR code and a text file containing their details. 
It saves a lot of time by generating IDs of multiple people within a few seconds, which otherwise takes a lot of time if to be done manually.



Instructions to run the Program -

1. Make sure that all the files are in the same directory where the P1.py file is present

2. fonts folder should be in the same directory where the P1.py file is present

3. Test_Data.xlsx, sample.jpg files should also be in the same directory where the P1.py file is present

4. Open the P1.py file in any Python IDE/interpreter

5. Write the ID pattern code in the space provided for the code.

5. Make sure that all the dimension values of the qr_code, text are set according to the requirements

6. Run the P1.py file

7. Select the Test_Data.xlsx when the dialog box opens

8. After the execution of the code an 'Test_Data.xlsx WorkBook Done.' message should be printed on the terminal

9. You can find the ID's and QR codes of all the students in a newly created folder 'QR_Codes' in the same directory
